**Key Details:**
1. Libraries Used
- pandas for data manipulation
- seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization
- plotly and cufflinks for interactive visualizations

2. Data Loading
- Reads a dataset named hospital_appointment.csv

3. Data Cleaning
- Replaces "M" with "Male" and "F" with "Female" in the "Gender" column
- Checks for unique values in the "Status" column

4. Data Exploration & Visualization
- Gender Distribution:
   A pie chart is plotted showing the ratio of male and female patients
   Conclusion: 65% are female patients, while 35% are male

  Other visualizations are expected, such as bar charts, scatter plots, or correlation matrices.
